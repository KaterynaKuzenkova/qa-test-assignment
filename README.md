# Quality Assurance engineer test
Welcome to the QA Engineer tech test. We expect the work to take around 1 to 1.5 hours, and we thank
you in advance for taking that time for us!

This test consists of two parts: a written part as a Documentation and a coding part as an Automation Testing Assignment.

## Documentation:
For the written part, we would
like to receive a PDF, slide presentation or preferably an MD file (readme) with your insights. Weâ€™ll evaluate how is your way of working when dealing with an automation challenge, but you can explore this opportunity beyond the scope of this simple challenge by explaining how you proceed with the analysis of this project, planning of your tasks, technical solution selection, design pattern choice, implementation, execution, etc.

You can think about this written part both as the presentation of the project to a stakeholder and as the technical documentation for the team who could join you for maintaining or extending the project with instructions about how to use it.


## Automated Testing Assignment

For the coding part you can clone this repo (with ```--bare``` and push the solution with ```--mirror```  to a new repo in your account) and run:

```
$ python -m http.server 8000
```

You now have a working frontend app that you will write some kind of automated user acceptence tests for.

Your choice for language and framework are up to you, however we would prefer JS, TS or PY and possible the Playwright framework, given we use these internally.
